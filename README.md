Babel drafts
============

Internet-drafts related to the
[Babel routing protocol](https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/babel/).  The
in-progress version is stored without a version number
(e.g. *draft-ietf-babel-rfc6126bis*), and whenever a version is submitted,
it is archived under its final name (e.g. *draft-ietf-babel-rfc6126bis-00*).

Discussion about these drafts should happen on the
[IETF Babel mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/babel).
Please do not submit pull requests to this repository, prefer sending
a patch to the list.

The IETF *Note Well* (included below) applies to all contributions.


Note Well
---------

Any submission to the IETF intended by the Contributor for publication
as all or part of an IETF Internet-Draft or RFC and any statement made
within the context of an IETF activity is considered an "IETF
Contribution".  Such statements include oral statements in IETF sessions,
as well as written and electronic communications made at any time or
place, which are addressed to:

  * The IETF plenary session
  * The IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG
  * Any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any working
    group or design team list, or any other list functioning under IETF
    auspices
  * Any IETF working group or portion thereof
  * Any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session
  * The IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB
  * The RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function

All IETF Contributions are subject to the rules of

(updated by [RFC 4879](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4879.txt)).

Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other
function, that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF activity,
group or function, are not IETF Contributions in the context of this
notice.  Please consult
